1) Load all the provided files in the "Problem 2" folder into your MATLAB directory. This should include ensemble.m, recognize.m, X_test.mat, X_train.mat, y_test.mat and y_train.mat.

2) Run recognize.m to get the accuracies of SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors and the Neural Network.

3) Run ensemble.m to get the accuracy of the ensemble.
